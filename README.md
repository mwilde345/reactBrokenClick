```
clone https://github.com/mwilde345/reactBrokenClick;
cd reactBrokenClick;
npm install;
npm start;
```

The click on a node and view the console output.
Take a look at the click handler in App.js to see what is breaking.

As far as I can tell it must be something to do with this library. Need to research more. I was hoping someone would confirm that 
this is not a normal issue.
